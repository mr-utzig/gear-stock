# Structure:

```
.
├── cmd                         # Command line interface and main application entry points.
│   └── myapp                   # Main application directory.
│       ├── cli                 # CLI-specific code, such as command definitions and parsers.
│       │   ├── cli.go          # CLI tool setup and command configuration.
│       └── main.go             # Entry point of the application.
├── internal                    # Application's internal codebase, not accessible from outside.
│   ├── application             # Application layer: orchestrates the application flow, configuration, and CQRS implementation.
│   │   ├── app.go              # Application configuration and initialization.
│   │   ├── command             # Command side of CQRS: handles the execution of commands.
│   │   │   └── command.go      # Command handling (CQRS).
│   │   └── query               # Query side of CQRS: handles data retrieval requests.
│   │       └── query.go        # Query handling (CQRS).
│   ├── domain                  # Core domain logic: entities, aggregates, services, and repository interfaces.
│   │   ├── aggregate           # Domain aggregates, representing collections of entities that are processed together.
│   │   ├── entity              # Domain entities, the fundamental objects of the business context.
│   │   ├── repository          # Domain repository interfaces, abstract definitions for data access layers.
│   │   └── service             # Domain services, containing business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or aggregate.
│   ├── genmocks.go             # Mock generation for testing, facilitating unit and integration testing.
│   ├── infrastructure          # Infrastructure layer: frameworks, drivers, and tools for technical capabilities.
│   │   ├── api                 # API interfaces, particularly HTTP for web interaction.
│   │   │   └── rest            # REST-specific implementations: servers, handlers, middleware.
│   │   │       ├── handler     # REST handlers, processing incoming HTTP requests.
│   │   │       ├── middleware  # REST middleware, intercepting requests for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication.
│   │   │       └── validator   # REST request validation, ensuring requests meet the expected format.
│   │   ├── decorator           # Decorators for enhancing or altering behavior (e.g., logging, metrics).
│   │   │   ├── decorator.go    # Base decorators, potentially for cross-cutting concerns.
│   │   │   └── logging.go      # Logging decorator, adding logging capabilities to operations.
│   │   └── pgsql               # PostgreSQL implementation: models and repositories for the database.
│   │       ├── model           # Data models for PostgreSQL, representing the database structure in code.
│   │       └── repository      # Domain repository implementation for PostgreSQL, concrete data access operations.
│   └── mocks                   # Mocks for testing, automatically generated or manually crafted stubs for unit tests.
└── pkg                         # Shared libraries and utilities, potentially reusable across different projects.
